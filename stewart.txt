I am an aspiring software engineer, with the goal of creating software that can help educate others. 
In an attempt to break into this new (for me) field, I am returning to school for an Associates in programming
and I've just started working with more experienced professional programmers.

My previous experience is with geology and hydrology. I have a passion to clean up and repurpose waste resources
and mitigate contamination. Not to be redundant, but I also want to create education tools with the goal of
better and more widespread education.
